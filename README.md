# SDA Church App

This is the GraphQL version of this project.

Firebase is a very cool platform, but its biggest drawback is the lack of data structure and constrains, and above everything else, **missing relationships**.

GraphQL on the other hand is pretty powerful in terms of data.

[Graph.cool](https://www.graph.cool) is my main choice, simply because:

- It has free tier
- UI is pretty nice and makes a lot of sense all the time
- Unrestricted integration with other 3rd party providers
- Unrestricted number of functions call
