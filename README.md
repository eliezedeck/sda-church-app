# SDA Church App

This is the Firebase version of this project.

Firebase offers attractive features, here are ones that fired my interests to use this platform:

- **Phone Auth** -- by far, this is the most attractive feature of all, at least for me. This is like killing 2 birds with 1 stone, I get user to login to the application, and I also get their confirmed phone number. What remains is to have the user fill-in his/her name in the profile page.
- Realtime database, to make the application feel alive and interactive.
- Free hosting + custom domain + SSL.
- Tons of Mobile app features.
