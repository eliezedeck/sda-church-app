# SDA Church App

Firebase was an attractive platform to develop on, but unfortunately, the features are deceptively simple but very hard to create applications with diverse data entities, especially the **lack of joins**. More that this, it doesn't provide *data ready* callback, and you're just supposed to consider the returned values the current, and no way to know that it's actually empty or because of network glitch it is currently empty.
